In her free time she enjoys baking, watching tv shows, spending time outdoors, and convincing herself to go for runs (but she never actually executes them).\nEmail: sanarayanan@g.hmc.edu"

    "text": "Hello Everyone! This is my first blog post on my intial reflections and goals I have for this semester with MicroPs. I am excited to work with microprocessors to build various projects throughout the semester.\nSome of my goals for this semester include:\n\nBuild a good understanding of embedded systems: I want to get comfortable reading datasheets, working with GPIOs, and understanding how microcontrollers interact with external hardware. I also want to understand how different systems can be connected and can communicate with each other in a synchronus way.\nBuild confidence in programming microcontrollers: I want to get more experience in writing the code to interact with microcontrollers effectively, and be able to control various aspects of it through software. I also want to sharpen my debugging skills.\nImprove my design thought-process: I want to be thoughtful with the way I design and craft my project to make sure it is optimal and scalable.\nConnect learnings and labs to real-world applications: I want to use whatever we learn and build through this class to connect it to applications outside, and build better intuition for how some complex systems work.\nCollaborate with classmates: I know some projects can be challenging and require a team effort, so I want to get to know other classmates and collaborate with them throughout the course.\nBuild a cool final projcet: I hope to use all the skills we’ve picked up along the way, and other learning we’ve encountered to build a cool, novel, exciting final project that I am really proud of!\nMake sure I understand all the concepts: I want to make sure I understand everything that is being taught, and reach out in case something is unclear to me, or if I have any doubts."
