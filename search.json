    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nThere were various steps in implementing this lab. The first thing that I needed to do was decide how I was going to handle switch-bouncing and decide how I would move in and out of various stages of properly registering a keypad press. In order to decide this, I came up with a design of an FSM that would control how I could transition between states based on a given input. Initially, I decided that I would begin in a SCAN state, where I apply power to the columns and then read the rows, to determine if a button is pressed. As soon as I determine a button is pressed (reading a 1 on the row outputs), I would move to the DEBOUNCE_WAIT state, where I implented my debounce logic. For me, I thought it would be the simplest to have a counter that acts as a delay/buffer for around 100ms, after which the switch connection should stabalize, and debouncing should no longer occur. After this counter is over, then I move onto the CAPTURE state, in which I shift the numbers on the display (the right number shifts to the left, and the new number appears on the right), and I wait in this state until the exact button was pressed is released. During the entire FSM, I have various control signals and enable signals that get asserted to determine what functionality I want to achieve (e.x. triggering a power applying FSM to read my keypad, enabling a counter, updating my display, etc.). Regardless, once the button is released from my CAPTURE state, I move to the DEBOUNCE_WAIT state again in order to mitigate any effects of switch debouncing on the release of a button, and then after the timer completes here, I again move back to SCAN to scan through my keypad until another button is pressed. In transitioning through these states, I had to be careful on what control signals I was asserting, because for example, if we are in the DEBOUNCE_WAIT state, we don’t want to accept any other new button presses on the display.\nFor this lab, partitioning is an extrememly important aspect of it in order to ensure ease of testing, debugging, and to isolate various features of my design. For this lab, I decided to have a main fsm to transition through the states listed above, a keypad scanner to apply voltage to my columns and try to read my rows - which gets passed through a synchronizer, a number capture module to correlate the rows and columns to a hex number which gets fed into my seve segment display module to turn on segments on my display, as well as clock dividers.\nIn order to test the design, I isolated each of my modules and tested them individually. For my combinational logic, it was straightforward because I generated all possible input signals and ensured the output from my module matched what I was expecting to read. For my other modules which are based on more asynchronus inputs, I had to turn on and off, and toggle my signals at variosu times to test that on a certain input, I move or do not move to a particular state. Or, if I am in a state that should not be changing based on an input, that it doesn’t do so when I apply an input. For example, for my state machine described above, I would first make sure that when I begin, I start off in the SCAN state, and when I read a row with a 1 in it, I move onto the next state. And then once I am in this state, I try changing the row, but it does not change states, because now it should be in the DEBOUNCE_WAIT state, where it waits for a timer to reach the value, and until then it essetially freezes the system. Then, after the timer is completed, I check that we move on to the CAPTURE state, where I check that the new number is on the right side of the segment, and the previous input is shifted to the left. In my top level module, I also do something similar, but using the clock signal that I pass to everything, and instead of manually having to set some of the inputs, the other modules can take care of a lot of that for me. There would be times in my testbench where I run my clock for multiple cycles, and either make sure the system is retained in it’s state, or that after a period of time it has transitioned to the next state.\nI made all my testbenches assert based so it was easy to check for various inputs given an input that I apply at a specific time.\nI made sure to calculate appropriate resistor values based on the maximum drivable current as well for all my pins.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Image of the physical setup\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the physical implementation the breadboard with the time-multiplexed segment visible, along with the keypad wired up."

    "text": "Technical Documentation:\nThe source code for the project can be found in the associated Github repository\n\nBlock Diagram\n The block diagram in Figure 2 demonstrates the overall design and architecture of the design. The top-level module incldes seven sub-modules - the HSOSC (high-speed oscillator block), two clock dividers (one for the time multiplexed segment, and one for the debounce timer), the keypad scanner to read button presses, the number capture to transform the pressed row and column to the keypad hex number, the main state machine, and the seven_segment module in order to convert hex digits to seven segments. We can see the internal logic of the muxes as well, in order to multiplex the values given to the seven-segment module, based on the generated clock signal.\n\n\nSchematic\n Figure 3 demonstrates the physical layout of the design. We have our keypad and a visual of how it is wired with pull down resistors on the input pins into the FPGA, so if we are not driving a signal through a button press we read a 0 (since my system is active high). We see that the inputs into my FPGA from the matrix keypad is wired to a pull down 680-ohm resistor. I didn’t do much of a calculation for this, since I just needed a resistor to pull down my system to ground so my signals wouldn’t float, without it being too large to act as a brick wall to the current. We can also see my reset push-button, PNP transistors which was calculated with a 3.3k-ohm resistor on the base, and my seven-segment display, where each segment had a current-limiting resistor of 200-ohms.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Current Calculations\n\n\nIn Figure 4 we can see all the calculations performed to ensure we are not drawing more current that possible from the FPGA pins - 8mA, and not driving floating signals to the FPGA.\n\n\nFinite State Machines and Transition/Output Tables and Tradeoffs\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Main FSM State Transition Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Main FSM State Transition Table\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Main FSM State Output Table\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Keypad Scanner FSM Transition table and output table\n\n\nIn Figure 5, we can see the main FSM diagram going through SCAN, DEBOUNCE_WAIT, and CAPTURE. In Figure 6, we see the state transition diagram table. In Figure 7, we have the main FSM output table. In Figure 8, we have the Keypad scanner FSM transition table and output table. I didn’t include a diagram of the counter FSM since that is self-explanatory.\nTradeoffs: There may be some tradeoffs with my strategy and others, right from how I partioned my blocks versus how my debouncing strategy could have been implented. For debouncing, I have one counter that counts to a fixed amount, and after this it assumes that debouncing affects are mitigated, and proceeds to the next stage. However, if I have a partcicularly bad switch which debounces for longer, then my strategy might not account for that time interval, and could fail. Additionally, if I have the same design, but have a switch with almost no debouncing, then I could be waiting for longer than I need to be. One design tradeoff I kept here was consistency and simplicity of the design - I could have alternatively, had a counter which checks how many consecutive high’s I get, and if it passes a certain threshold, then I would move on. However, this implementation also has the limitation of setting the appropriate threshold. Additionally, I have one state which does all the scanning logic, whereas I could have 4 different states for scanning, each of which applies power to one row. My strategy is easy in the sense of I turn on an enable in my SCAN state and it hits all the cols to read the rows through another FSM. This design gives me another piece of hardware potentially, with an external counter - but it is really small and should not have much of an effect, compared to 4 state counters within my main FSM. However, in the CAPTURE state, when I need to check if a button is released, I essentially only need to apply power to the column in which I detected the press in, so have a single state to account for putting power to just that column would have been easy overall, rather than having a conditional, but overall I don’t see much of a design hit with this approach. I also like how I have enables which I set as output signals in my FSM, and it automatically triggers a clock counter/clock divider module to take care of it, and then when that module asserts a high, it continues. This makes the design separation really easy, and a lot easier to test, debug, and isloate."

Modularizing the prompts gave it more space to have it be more detailed in some of the logic implementation, and made it easier to understand, but overall in the initial prompt, it wasn’t that difficult to follow. However, the last prompt was easier to read, and it was more similar to a more traditional transition and fsm. Prototype A, did not modularize the design in the way I thought it would - but it had the main ways I broke mine up, however I had more modules. It didn’t make any illogical splits, but overall it was near and clear. ChatGPT used clog2 for a counter logic which was something I did not think about, and it created functions within the module which was something I don’t have exposure to.\nOverall, I would rate the quality of this code pretty good since it seems to be optimal in all the assignments, module interaction, and clock multiplexing that it does. The AI code synthesized all three times, I tried it, however the later versions were more clean. In terms of warning messages, I just got the expression size 32 bits truncated to fit in target size 16, but I have also been getting this warning message as well."

    "section": "Design and Testing Methodology",
    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nIn order to approach the design of the project, I first had to look through the reference/programming manual of the STMLK324KC microcontroller, as well as the interrupt lecture slides to understand the flow of logic that needs to be configured to enable interrupts. I used some of the provided header and C files, as well as the timer configuration files from my last lab, however I removed the structs as for this lab we could directly use the stm32l432xx.h header. However, I kept the .c functions the same as it had specially defined functions to configure our clocks and flash. In terms of design for the motor calcualtions, if we trap on any of A’s edges, and B is the opposite signal then we can determine a clockwise direction of motion. Similarly, if we trap on any of B’s edges, and A is the same signal, then we are going clockwise. Otherwise, we are moving in the counter clockwise. So, I connected the input pins (PA9 –&gt; A and PA10 –&gt; B) to interrupt lines (PA9 connects to line 9, PA10 connects to line 10), adn configured the interrupts to trap on both rising and falling edges of the square-wave encoder pulse. Then, on an interrupt, it goes to that line’s IRQ interrupt handler function, where I check for the interrupt on the exact line I care about (9 in EXTI9_5 handler, and 10 in EXTI15_10 handler), clear it by writing 1 to it, and perform my calculations. Here I check for the edges of A and B on the trap to get direction (I can tell which encoder signal I trapped on based on which interrupt handler I went to/which interrupt flag bit went to 1). Then, on these interrupts I also keep a running total of the number of pulses I have in the cw and ccw directions which then gets used in my tim16 interrupt handler function. For tim16, I have the tim 16 timer configured to 1 second, after which it raises the UIF flag and traps into its tim16 interrupt handler. Once I am here, I check how many pulses I had in the second, and divide that by the motors ppr (pulses per revolution), which is 408 from the datasheet to give me angular velocity (rev/sec). I then clear the counter to start fresh for the next 1 second interval. Additionally, once I hit the interrupt handler for the timer, I set a display flag to 1, which if true in the main function, it prints out the direction and angular velocity to the debug console.\nThe use of interrupts over polling techniques have different pros and cons. With interrupts, we can configure it so that as soon as an event is detected it will trap, pause all other execution, save the architectural state, and handle the interrupt before resuming normal program flow. This requires less hardware, and can almost instantaneously detect an event and handle it. Additionally, priorities can be set so that different interrupts can take precedents over others based on what may be more important. However, sometimes certain interrupts can pause all other execution, and if we want something to happen in parallel it could affect that. On the other hand, polling would require more hardware and continuous checking to determine if an event happened, and there could be a lag in when an event is detected to when it occurs, or it is possible that polling misses the event, in the case that the event happens in between a clock cycle - although unlikely if polling at high speeds.\n Image 1 above displays the flowchart with the control logic flow, and how interrupts are handeled, and how that is built into the main function."

First off, in the code, it uses the masks defined in the header files for the stm32l432xx.h, whereas I directly accessed the bits using bit shifting, and did not use a predefined mask. Additionally, the logic does not consider setting up encoder B’s pin signal on the SYSCFG-&gt;EXTICR register which is interesting. I guess, it is not using the highest resolution in the design which is why it is only operating on the rising and falling edge of one of the signals. Furthermore, it is not calculating the direction of the motor based on the values of the encoder pulses, and is also not calculating the angular velocity properly. I also think in the interrupt handler, it is it checking for both bits of the encoder pins at the same time, however in order to determine direction, you need to address the cases differently for the values of the pulses. Furthermore, I am not sure if it knows to use 5V tolerant pins, so this is not really a consideration it made. However, overall it did try to pick pins on the same interrupt line to make it easier to handle with just one interrupt request handler function."

We also soldered on the FPGA and micro-controller as well.\nAfter the soldering was done, we proceeded to test our board. We first loaded a test program to the FPGA which uses the high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitve library. Here, this library is used to generate a clock signal at 24Mhz, and then counter was implemented in order to produce a blinking frequency of 1.5Hz, so that we could see it on the LEDs. This was developed with a clock-divider module. After this, we uploaded another program to our FPGA which toggles pin P25 at around 1Hz, and if switch SW7 is on, then P25 is connected to PA9 which will see LED D3 blinking. We then, uploaded a program to our MCU unit, which reads the value of the toggled LED from the FPGA and echoes it to another pin which then causes LED D2 blinking.\nWe then implemented the 7-segment code in verilog, which was essetially a decoder. Along with this, we programmed some switch inputs to control 3 other on-board FPGA LEDs using combinational logic, and using the HSOSC to take teh 24MHz signal and convert it into a 2.4Hz signal which was reflected in a blinking LED. I then used an oscilliscope to test the frequency of the blinking LED and it was exactly 2.4Hz. Figure 1 below shows this.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Oscilliscope Trace showing the 2.4Hz signal on the bottom right\n\n\nAfter this, we had to build the 7-segment LED display on a breadboard. After looking at the specs, I was able to apply power to one of the middle pins on either side, and ground the respective other pins in order to turn on that respective segment. Each non-power pin on the displaywas then hooked to ground through a 10kohm resistor. I made sure to connect the programmed pins from the FPGA to the seven-segment display. In order to test this, I created a self-checking testbench which ran through all posisble inputs and made sure the outputs were as expected."

Figure 8 shows the successful response.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Lattice Synthesis Result\n\n\nOverall, I would say that the quality of this verilog is really nice, with a very exact counter. This was similar to how I learned it in E85 last semester for my music lab, and therefore how I implemented it myself. The LLM did generate some constructs like parameter int, which I have never used before. The code did synthesize the first time around, which is impressive. However, this is also a common application of clock dividing, so it must have been trained on a lot of relevant data. There were very small errors such as bit truncation for optimization.\nNext time I use LLM in my workflow, it is important to understand how to prompt the model, it is important to give it the constraints you are working under, and even providing specific library names are important. I was really surprised when the LLM picked up on the HSOSC library and the documentation for the syntax."

    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nThere were various steps in implementing this lab. First, we could use the base code from lab 1, which was displaying a single DIP switches input into one seven segment LED display. But, for this lab, we created a clock which toggled at 60Hz from a clock divider - around the frequency of flicker free viewing for humans. Then, every 60Hz I would toggle a signal, which woudl essentially be the select signal for a mux which would decide which DIP switche’s input to display on the LED. Based on which DIP switch’s input was selected, that would be fed into the single, shared, seven segment module instantiation which would then display that number on the display. However, because we made our new clock toggle at 60Hz, the flicker free viewing frequency, both switch numbers are toggling so fast it looks like they are both displayed on the LED-display at the same time. Due to this, when building the circuit on the breadboard, I would only need 7 pins to connect to all the 14 different segments on the dual-display, because we designed it so that only 7 segments can be driven at a time, since there is only one seven segment module decoder. Additionally, the FPGA does not have enough power to drive the dual-segment LED display, so we had to connect the output of the FPGA pins to a PNP transistor which was connected to a 3.3V collecter, so everytime a high signal was asserted by any of the pins it would pull current from the collecter in order to provide enough power to the dual display. I had an enable signal that was two bits wide, and depending on the clock signal, would either provide a base to one of the two PNP transistors. And we also had 5 LEDs which would just display the sum of both the dip switches.\nIn order to test the design, I first isolated my clock divider module, so I could test that the clock was indeed running 60Hz. I created my own clock signal in the testbench, and then asserted that after 60Hz from the testbench, we were also toggling the clock in my clock module. Essentially, I made sure both clocks were running at the same frequency.\nThen, in order to test the rest of my design, I had another testbench. This time, I did not use testvectors, but rather leveraged assert statements. I generated a counter that was 8-bits wide, and each time it would split this 8-bit bus into two 4-bit busses, which would simulate the inputs on both by 4-input DIP switches. I then made sure the addition of the led signal was equal to the sum of both of 4-bit busses. And then, based on the enable signal asserted from my top-level module, I made sure that the actual seven-segment output, matched with the one I was chosing based on the enable signal and switch value.\nI made sure to calculate appropriate resistor values based on the maximum drivable current as well for all my pins.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Image of the physical setup\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the physical implementation the breadboard with the time-multiplexed segment visible."

Initially it created two different instances of the module, because it maybe missed out on the idea of multiplexing, but after I prompted it to only instantiate one module, it created the output above which looks correct to me, and it synthesized fine.\nFigure 9 shows the seven segment display decoder code that it generated, which also compiled fine and seems optimized and reasonable.\nOverall, I would rate the quality of this code pretty good since it seems to be optimal in all the assignments, module interaction, and clock multiplexing that it does. In terms of verilog contstructs that were unknown to me, I did not see anything striking - I have used almost everything used in the AI version. However, the AI did make the counter a little different to mine, with the addition, and counter limit check under the same else conditional, however this was just a design decision. The AI code synthesized both times, I tried it, however the first time there was a logic gap in the way it did the time multiplexing. One important thing is that it is not running at the right frequency, it is running too fast since it is just using the HSOSC, so this would be something that might need more prompting. In terms of warning messages, I just got the expression size 32 bits truncated to fit in target size 16, but I have also been getting this warning message as well. The next time, I might give it a little more context on what I have available, and perhaps define some of the terms I am using - although this shouldn’t have been necessary. Also, it did not use the HSOSC oscillator that I am using because it did not have the context of the lab, and what we were using.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: ChatGPT output after giving it related files\n\n\nThe output of the LLM after providing it with my seven segment decoder and the HSOSC code, is outlined in figure 10. This code good quality, but it did change quite a bit in terms of structure from the previous version. Again, the frequency is not correct as it is going too fast. It also split up the different parts of the code like the PNP enable signals, and the seg calcualtions into different stages which might make it more readable, but it is still functionally correct. There were no warning messages from this that were alarming - it is just interesting that it changed the structure into different units based on my lab 1 code that I had provided."

Instead, I used the debugger to walk through the logic of my code, and I brought up all the relevant register signals, so I could see how every line I was working through was changing the state of the MCU, and if I saw that something wasn’t happening according to how I wanted, then I would revise the datasheet.

There might have been a limitation here on what breakout board we could use, which is something the AI system wouldn’t know possibly, because it may not know what pins we can directly address and write to. Overall, the quality of the output is decent, especially in terms of the chain of logic because it did consider many levels of planning, including talking about the prescalar, arr, clock enable, channel output, etc. All of which I am really impressed about, however there was not much information given as to why TIM2 was chosen over the other timers. The LLM did not generate any code for me, but it did talk about similar registers to what I modified, so it might be pretty close. Because the LLM did not give much reasoning about the timer, it was difficult to compare it to my approach. TIM16 gave a clear pinout to connect to for my PWM on my breakout board, which was one of the main reasons I chose it, however Chat said because it is 32-bits it avoids a “prescalar headache[s]”. It says TIM2 has the simplest, which I do not entirely agree with.
