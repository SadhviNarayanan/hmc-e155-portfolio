    "text": "Hello Everyone! This is my first blog post on my intial reflections and goals I have for this semester with MicroPs. I am excited to work with microprocessors to build various projects throughout the semester.\nSome of my goals for this semester include:\n\nBuild a good understanding of embedded systems: I want to get comfortable reading datasheets, working with GPIOs, and understanding how microcontrollers interact with external hardware. I also want to understand how different systems can be connected and can communicate with each other in a synchronus way.\nBuild confidence in programming microcontrollers: I want to get more experience in writing the code to interact with microcontrollers effectively, and be able to control various aspects of it through software. I also want to sharpen my debugging skills.\nImprove my design thought-process: I want to be thoughtful with the way I design and craft my project to make sure it is optimal and scalable.\nConnect learnings and labs to real-world applications: I want to use whatever we learn and build through this class to connect it to applications outside, and build better intuition for how some complex systems work.\nCollaborate with classmates: I know some projects can be challenging and require a team effort, so I want to get to know other classmates and collaborate with them throughout the course.\nBuild a cool final projcet: I hope to use all the skills we’ve picked up along the way, and other learning we’ve encountered to build a cool, novel, exciting final project that I am really proud of!\nMake sure I understand all the concepts: I want to make sure I understand everything that is being taught, and reach out in case something is unclear to me, or if I have any doubts."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn this lab, we built out motherboard with the FPGA and the microcontroller through soldering, and tested our board by loading designs onto our FPGA nad microcontroller. We implemented a design on the FPGA to test the on-board high-speed oscillator by blinking one of the on-board LEDs. And we implemented a program on the microcontroller to light an LED. Overall, the main goal after creating our boards was to create a seven segment display. We wrote verilog to convert a 4-bit hex inputted through a switch into display using 7-segments. We did this by programming pins on the FPGA based on the switches, and then connecting this to a physical build of a seven-segment display on a breadboard to observe the numbers. We also used the switches to light other LEDs on the FPGA, and like described earlier, we used the on-board high-speed oscillator to blind an on-board led at 2.4Hz.\n\n\nDesign and Testing Methodology\nThere were two different steps associated with the hardware component of the design, with the first one being the soldering of the components. There were two main parts to soldering the components to the motherboard - we had to solder on the SMD components, and the THT components as well. We also soldered on the FPGA and micro-controller as well. After the soldering was done, we proceeded to test our board. We first loaded a test program to the FPGA which uses the high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitve library. Here, this library is used to generate a clock signal at 24Mhz, and then counter was implemented in order to produce a blinking frequency of 1.5Hz, so that we could see it on the LEDs. This was developed with a clock-divider module. After this, we uploaded another program to our FPGA which toggles pin P25 at around 1Hz, and if switch SW7 is on, then P25 is connected to PA9 which will see LED D3 blinking. We then, uploaded a program to our MCU unit, which reads the value of the toggled LED from the FPGA and echoes it to another pin which then causes LED D2 blinking. We then implemented the 7-segment code in verilog, which was essetially a decoder. Along with this, we programmed some switch inputs to control 3 other on-board FPGA LEDs using combinational logic, and using the HSOSC to take teh 24MHz signal and convert it into a 2.4Hz signal which was reflected in a blinking LED. I then used an oscilliscope to test the frequency of the blinking LED and it was exactly 2.4Hz. [IMAGE HERE] After this, we had to build the 7-segment LED display on a breadboard. After looking at the specs, I was able to apply power to one of the middle pins on either side, and ground the respective other pins in order to turn on that respective segment. Each non-power pin on the displaywas then hooked to ground through a 10kohm resistor. I made sure to connect the programmed pins from the FPGA to the seven-segment display. In order to test this, I created a self-checking testbench which ran through all posisble inputs and made sure the outputs were as expected.\n\n\nTechnical Documentation:\nThe source code for the project can be found in the associated Github repository"
